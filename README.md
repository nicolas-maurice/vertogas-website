# Gasuni
This project aims to build a Single Page Application that properly retrieve data by fecthing some REST API. It uses [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) as main underlying technology. Choosing React can be argued by multiple reasons, main ones being
 - React is an high performing Front End library
 - React makes no assumptions on the rest of your stack. In particular it can be easily combined with any Back End technology
 - React is Component-Based so it allows to write very clear and predictable code (this is even more true when using Redux)
 - React is very popular and the community is very active, making it very straight forward to skill up on
